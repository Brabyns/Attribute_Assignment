        <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Nice  was an English
            mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose
            computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is now considered to be the first
            algorithm intended for implementation on a machine.</p>

        <p>Kelvin Nice is often regarded as the world's first computer programmer for her work on the Analytical Engine,
            and her insights laid the foundation for the development of modern computing.</p>

        <p>This tribute is a small acknowledgment of her pioneering contributions to the field of computer science.</p>
